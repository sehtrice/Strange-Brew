# Strange-Brew
The place for things that don't have a designated place yet, but that I don't want to loose track of.

Content in this repo is mostly scripts, but also ocasionally notes, and other items that are small. Such as templates, examples of configs, visio's, pics of whiteboard sessions, etc.

Add to the .gitignore anything that is sensitive such as credentials. Or anything that is large such as binary or ISO files that can be downloaded from another location.

If items of this repo begin to support production efforts for anyone but myself, then those items need to be moved to a dedicated production repo.

Otherwise it's a repo with reference content for anyone who's interested.
